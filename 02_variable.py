#Welcome to chapter 2 variables and datatypes 
from tkinter import Variable


a = "Soumyajit" #this one is a string
b = 345 #this one is a number
c = 45.32 # this is a float 
d = None #this is none type
# variables can be consider as containers of kitchen 
#Data types 
#primarily there are five types of datatypes in python 
# 1. String 
# 2. Floating number / Floats 
# 3. Number 
# 4. boolean 
# 5. None

# There is no need to tell what datatype a variable is  its identified automatically 
#Printing the variables 
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(type(a))

# What name you can give to python variables
# 1. Variable can't start with number Ex. 1a = 2 is wrong
# 2. Variable should start with alphabet or with underscore like _a = 2 will work
# 3. No white space is allowed inside a variable name 
# Note numbers can be used inside variable name but not on start
