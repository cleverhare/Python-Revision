# Tuples in Python 
t = (1,2,3,4,5)

# Printing the elements of tuples 
print(t[0])

# Tuples values couldn't be updated 
# t[0]  = 23 is an invalid syntax 
# Making an empty tuple
t1 = ()
print(t1)

# Tuple with only one element 
t2 = (1,) #Tuple with single element And its the right way 
# Wrong way 
# t2 = (1)
print(t2)
